Create Prod database
	Did dump of test database
	From C:\xampp\mysql\bin
	mysqldump -u root --extended-insert=false tomasosbarbershop_test > tomasosbarbershop_test_dump_10_22_2015.sql
	(note extended-insert=false writes the INSERT INTO query for each record)
Manage Users on database
Will need each user to have certain permissions on database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tomasosbarbershop_prod.Appointment TO 'username'@'servername'
GRANT READ ON tomasosbarbershop_prod.User TO 'username'@'servername'
Good read -> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql

Create users in database for different application users
Each username/password for the application will be the username/password used for the database


Update config file on server
Do NOT store prod config information on GitHub
Organize Git - need to use this for version control

Use htaccess file to only allow the range of IPs from within the store to access site
Find out where log files are written to on server (MySQL general log, PHP error log)

Give demo
Write manual
