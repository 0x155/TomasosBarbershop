IP ADDRESS OF SERVER:
23.254.204.46

NAMESERVER NAMES:
cns44524.hostwindsdns.com

Not this is NOT DNS
DNS - DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
-A massive network of computers which catalogs every domain and IP address on the internet
DNS attaches a domain name to an IP address, so you can enter a .com address instead of the IP address

A NAMESERVER is a server which has DNS software installed on it.
Nameservers return IP addresses, and have DNS software installed on them
DNS software technically can be installed on any web server
