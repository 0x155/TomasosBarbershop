Kieron wants the process of making an appointment to take less than one minute

Parent scenario:
Mom calls and wants her 3 sons to get haircuts
User is okay with entering mom's name, selecting haircut (or multiple services), and entering in notes that user will be in with her children
--display children's names and birthdays when a parent is searched
