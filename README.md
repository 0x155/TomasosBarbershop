# Barbershop Scheduler Application

Welcome to the Git repository for the Barbershop Scheduler Application.

### Intro
This codebase is for a web-based application which can be used by barbershops
or hair salons in order to schedule, manage, and view their appointments. It
also serves as a CRM application by providing stylists and store managers with
insightful information on their customers. This data includes not only basic contact information,
but customer visit history as well. Stylists can see when their first and last appointment was with
a customer, along with the details of all their visits in between.

### Technologies Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* DHTMLX Scheduler ([documentation])
* Bootstrap
* PHP
