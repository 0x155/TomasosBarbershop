Customers with children:
When adding a customer with children, add a question "Does this customer have children?" -> Yes -> How many? -> Enter a name, cell, birthday, and email for each child (the address and home number will be the same)
When searching for a customer with children, bring up a list of his/her children with a radio button next to each child. 
When that child is selected, choose date, time, employee, and type of service for each child (display all these fields inline), allow multple appointments to be made at once
-Make sure user is able to see calendar while this screen is displayed
-Store seperate database entries for each child. That way you can search for individual child (will eventually come in on his/her own)
"I'd like to bring my 3 sons in for a haircut, and get one myself" 
"I'd like to bring my 3 sons in for a haircut, and get coloring done"

Do not allow conflicting appointments to be made. If an employee has an appointment at a certain time, do not allow user to make another
appointment at all during that time (no overlap)

Hover over an item on the calendar and it will bring up more info about that appointment (customer name, phone#, email)
