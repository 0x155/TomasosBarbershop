THESE NOTES ARE ONLY FOR THE APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING ASPECT OF THE APPLICATION


TOUCH SCREEN




RESOLVED OPEN ITEMS
CANNOT SEE MAKE APPOINTMENT BUTTON WHEN MAKING SOMEONE UNAVAILABLE WHEN USING LAPTOP
--Added scroll bars when window overflowed - overflow:auto on column

Flow when adding a new customer (continue to make appointment, then add customer, or make appointment and then add customer)
-Bring up fields and only make name and cell phone required, fill in other stuff later (home phone, email, etc.)
name
phone
address
email
birthday (do not include year in birthday)
-Give user the option to fill new customers name in Customer Name field on main screen when done

Unavailable - do not include customer name
->Set customerName to employeeName if appointment selected is Unavailable

OUTSTANDING ITEMS (in order of priority)
DATABASE - MYSQL/PHP

Add line for "Is this customer a child of an existing customer?" If yes, show text field to enter parent's name

Confirmation screen once appointment is confirmed and scheduled
->Bring up modal window with appointment details, prompt user to close window or view appointment on calendar (go to that date), also display appointment info

Calendar date picker on main screen (instead of using back/forward arrows)

Limit user actions when clicking on an event in the calendar
Bring up appointment and customer information when viewing info of appointment on calendar

On Search results screen, make each row a div, and if that div is clicked, then select the radio button in that row. Also add hover effect for each row.
This will allow users on touch screen to just touch the row to select the customer

JQuery v.s JS optimizations

Allow user to make multiple, sequential appointments (haircut, then beard trim for example)
->Add a checkbox next to Make Appointment button and do not clear customer name if user checks this box

Recurring appointments (Every 1 week, 3 weeks, etc.)

Reseting fields once appointment is scheduled

Noting customer allergies (make note in appointment, and make name on calendar bold so user sees it is different)

Customers with children:
When adding a customer with children, add a question "Does this customer have children?" -> Yes -> How many? -> Enter a sex, name, cell, birthday, and email for each child (the address and home number will be the same)
	What if adding kid seperately (not along with parent)
When searching for a customer with children, search will bring up a list of his/her children with a radio button next to each child. 
Childs name will also display parent name in search result
When there is an exact match for customer search, display children names or parent name if one exisits in system
When that child is selected, choose date, time, employee, and type of service for each child (display all these fields inline), allow multple appointments to be made at once
-Make sure user is able to see calendar while this screen is displayed
-Store seperate database entries for each child. That way you can search for individual child (will eventually come in on his/her own)
"I'd like to bring my 3 sons in for a haircut, and get one myself" 
"I'd like to bring my 3 sons in for a haircut, and get coloring done" 


Error if the time entered is not within business hours for that day
	Note hours are different for different days of the week (M-R, F, Sat)
	Calendar will not show event but make sure user knows the appointment was not scheduled
Error when the start time is greater than the end time
Error when certain fields are blank

Do not allow conflicting appointments to be made. If an employee has an appointment at a certain time, do not allow user to make another
appointment at all during that time (no overlap)

Hover over an item on the calendar and it will bring up more info about that appointment (customer name, phone#, email)

Editing and Deleting appointments once scheduled

Spining logo next to Make Appointment button while appointment is being added

Tomaso's Barbershop logo somewhere on page?

Texting/Emailing a customer when appointment is scheduled
"This is Tomaso's Barbershop reminding you of you 10:00am color appointment with Tiara. Please call 631-589-5555 if you need to cancel or reschedule"
