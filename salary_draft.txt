Skillcrush says the total cost of living expenses, and overhead is divided by billable hours to determine minimum hourly rate to stay afloat

Need to determine the percentage overhead is of salary
$52,000 / $35,000 = 67%
$36/hour x .67 = $60/hour (this hourly rate includes overheads)
-This amount does not account for profits, this covers basic costs

Profit:
-Typically add no less than 10%
-Example uses 20%

$60 x .20 = 12
60 + 12 = $72/hour (in order to make 20% profit)
