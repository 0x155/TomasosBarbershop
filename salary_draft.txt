Base Salary = $30,000
Assoc. Cost - taxes, insurance, etc. (30% of salary) = $9,000
Total = $40,000

2,080 working hours per year
176 non-working hours (7 US holidays, 2 weeks vacation, 5 sick days)
1,904 billable hours per year

Estimate 25% of those hours is spent not-working -> 1,428 hours per year
-Billable hours are generally between 1,000 and 1,500

$40,000 / 1,428 = $28/hour
-cost to cover salary and associated costs

Overhead
Estimate $35,000 (includes office space, rent, utilites, phones, etc.)

Server Costs:
Most likely will need VPS (Virtual Private Server) over Shared, Dedicated is too much money and more responsibility

	http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-block-an-ip-on-my-linux-server/
	iptables -I INPUT -s ! {IP ADDRESS} -j DROP
	is iptables command to block all except IP ADDRESS
	
	Root folder is /var/zpanel/hostdata/zpanel/public_html/
	
	Can use .htaccess file to limit IPs
	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/htaccess.html
	http://www.htaccess-guide.com/how-to-use-htaccess/
	order deny,allow
	deny from all
	allow from 111.222.333.444
	--May need to modify the server config file instead (httpd.conf)
	
	
	Questions:
	What does your SLA list as the up-time?
	Do you perform regular backups, or do I have to implement my own?
	Do I need to install MySQL, PHP?
	Can I restrict the IP addresses which have access to the site?
	How can I make changes/upload changed files to my server?
	
	
	
Anything different need to be done for mobile hosting?
Upload files via an FTP client (FileZilla). FTP login details are under your account
How can I limit the IP addresses? There is IP ban, but I only want to allow certain ones
Are backups done automatically? If so, are all files and database backed up?
I am considering a login screen for my users, can you provide me with something like that, or do I need to create one?
My app is mostly JS, MySQL, and PHP. are these installed already?
How can I check/monitor/view performance?
	Google PageSpeed - but disables static and dynamic caching
In the cPanel demo, there were a number of different sections (domains, site improvement, wordpress, files, etc.). Do those come standard or do I choose which ones I need?

Skillcrush says the total cost of living expenses, and overhead is divided by billable hours to determine minimum hourly rate to stay afloat

Need to determine the percentage overhead is of salary
$52,000 / $35,000 = 67%
$36/hour x .67 = $60/hour (this hourly rate includes overheads)
-This amount does not account for profits, this covers basic costs

Profit:
-Typically add no less than 10%
-Example uses 20%

$60 x .20 = 12
60 + 12 = $72/hour (in order to make 20% profit)


Skillcrush article claims the low-end hourly rate is $40
